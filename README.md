# Datum
Im currently working part time for Datum, remotely, as a 'Blockchain Engineer'. I have and will be involved in different projects. I will upload the contributions that I can make public to this repo. 

## What is Datum? 
Datum is a decentralized and distributed high performance NOSQL database backed by a blockchain ledger. This technology allows anyone to backup structured data like social network data, data from wearables, smart home and other IOT devices in a secure, private and anonymous manner. Datum provides a marketplace where users can share or sell data on their own terms.

## My Experience
During the first month of my experience, I have been involved in Datum marketing. My main role has been to perform data analytics on our Pre Sale (which you can see in the Etherscan Analysis directory), spreading the word of Datum in different social media platform, such as Reddit and Forobits, and I was interviewed by a Colombian Radio Statios, W Radio, on Datum. You can access my interview here: http://play.wradio.com.co/play/audio/3570687/, from 0:22:35 to 0:27:23. Be aware, the interview is in Spanish.

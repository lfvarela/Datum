# Etherscan Analytics
This package includes some modules (in the `Modules` folder) for performing data analysis on Etherscan.io transactions for Ethereum based cryptocurrencies. 

My main use is to perform data analytics on Datum, which I currently form part of, but it can be applied to any transaction file from Etherscan.io's API. We also use ethplorer's API for some transaction data. 

You can also check out the `Sample Analytics` folder to check out different use cases for the modules.

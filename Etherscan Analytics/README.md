# Etherscan Analytics
This package includes some modules for performing data analysis on Etherscan.io transactions for Ethereum based cryptocurrencies. My main use is to perform data analytics on Datum, which I currently form part of, but it can be applied to any transaction file from Etherscan.io.

## Modules
- dataanalytics.py	
- myfilehandler.py
- mytimeconversions.py

## Sample Use Cases
- myAnalytics.py
- myAnalyticsContributorData.py
- myAnalyticsExcludingExtremities.py
